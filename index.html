            <p>
                While I struggle to set specific career goals in stone on a landscape as kaleidoscopic and shifting as
                computer science, I know independently of that shifting that I want to solve problems and help people,
                and I want to do that in a collaborative environment that promotes creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having spent a number of years working in network infrastructure with an encouraging team at
                <a href="https://cofc.edu" target="_blank">College of Charleston</a>
                that was always ready to explain and improve upon how things worked, I do have a special interest in
                computer networking &mdash; especially as it intersects with automation. I remember the thrill of
                getting to write my first script for automating firmware upgrades of
                <a href="https://www.tripplite.com/" target="_blank">Tripp Lite</a>
                UPSes, and then later the excitement of learning how to use
                <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank">Ansible</a>
                to manage bulk configuration changes across a network, and then later the hands-on fun of using that
                skill to configure a cluster of RHEL
                <a href="https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-2/latest/doc/01-about/" target="_blank">
                    Icinga 2
                </a>
                satellite servers for a new network monitoring and alerting system. Watching what amounts to a series of
                gears click into place and function together to serve a collective purpose is a beautiful thing. That's
                why I carry a steadfast interest in understanding, designing, and building systems of moving parts, as
                was probably evident to Dr. Gokhale in my work for his Distributed Systems course, or perhaps to my
                parents in my childhood obsession with setting up and subsequently toppling mile-long chains of
                Dominoes, or crafting weird Rube Goldberg machines. I aim to follow this interest in all of my
                professional pursuits moving forward, with the understanding that distributed systems can manifest in
                many forms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, anyone who has worked with me longer than a month knows I'm an automation fanatic, and that
                will certainly be a defining factor in my professional trajectory. This enthusiasm was kickstarted when
                I was an undergraduate at College of Charleston and
                <a href="https://bowringj.people.cofc.edu/" target="_blank">
                    Dr. Jim Bowring
                </a>
                tasked my classmates and I with building our own automated testing frameworks from scratch for existing
                open source software projects on GitHub. Over the course of this M.S. program, I got to dive into many
                automation-centric projects, some collaborative and some individual, that allowed me to really work on
                and improve my skills as an automator in the context of a deeper toolkit including tools like
                <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank">Ansible</a>,
                <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">
                    Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</a>,
                <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>,
                <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant by HashiCorp</a>,
                <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Kafka</a>, and distributed datastores like
                <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/" target="_blank">Couchbase</a>. Also, a significant part of my day
                job involves discussing and identifying opportunities for automation with my teammates and implementing
                solutions with scripting, API development, and other codeless tools like
                <a href="https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Power Automate</a>, e.g.,
                automating mass data synchronization from on-premise network shares to SharePoint online site
                collections, integrating our ITSM software with Cascade CMS to automate provisioning of accounts for new
                web content managers, using
                <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank">
                    GitHub Actions
                </a>
                and
                <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a>
                to automate the testing and deployment of a series of in-house web applications, and more. I find this
                kind of work, and more generally the
                <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/" target="_blank">
                    DevOps
                </a>
                domain, highly satisfying, and I aim to continuously integrate it, if you will, into my career as a
                technical professional.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last but especially not least, my love for full-stack web development is a major gravitational force in
                my life (pulling me primarily toward port 8000 on localhost, as
                <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a>
                is my favorite framework); the origin of this force was a research project with
                <a href="https://www.amhajja.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Ayman Hajja</a>
                at
                <a href="https://cofc.edu" target="_blank">College of Charleston</a>
                in the fall of 2017. Our project, which we titled PolyPy, was a pedagogical web application specifically
                focused on Python education; it allowed instructors to use a set of novel templating frameworks to
                generate many (<em>Poly</em>) quasi-random Python (<em>Py</em>) coding challenges, assign those
                challenges to their students, and view detailed reports to gain insight into both shared and individual
                strengths and weaknesses related to both reading and writing Python code. From this project (our work on
                which is published in the
                <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9028712" target="_blank">
                    2019 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference proceedings</a>), I learned that full-stack web
                development provided the perfect blend of art and problem solving; it was a colorful concoction of
                coding and creativity, and I was obsessed. The PolyPy project lasted only for two years but it
                ultimately ignited my interest in developing for the web which is still steadily aflame and which
                will certainly help to illuminate my future career path.
            </p>
            <p>
                The past year and a half of active engagement in Vanderbilt University's challenge-laden M.S. program,
                combined with my full-time, fused IT role spanning networking, DevOps, and full-stack web development,
                provides me with a unique perspective that I can wield confidently moving forward. While I cannot quite
                concretely picture myself in a specific position, company, or location five years from now, I am
                searching for opportunities to make positive, real-world impacts in collaborative and creative ways with
                a motivated team.
            </p>
            <h3>Academic Achievements During M.S. Program</h3>
            <p>
                Since starting the M.S. program in the summer of 2021, I have also held a full-time development job and
                have maintained a 4.0 GPA while taking two classes each semester. This isn't necessarily the most
                exciting or sparkling achievement, but nonetheless it is certainly a product of continuous hard work
                both academically and professionally. I learned early as a high school student that the objective with
                school is to learn and explore, not to get good grades &mdash; good grades tend to be the natural
                byproduct of excitement and interest, sort of like how wave function collapse in quantum mechanics is
                the natural byproduct of environmental interaction (I just learned this in
                <a href="http://www.chuckeasttom.com/" target="_blank">
                    Dr. Easttom's
                </a>
                Quantum Computing course). I say this to emphasize that my GPA has less to do with an obsession with my
                record than a real appetite for growing professionally. With this appetite &mdash; and a supplemental
                unwillingness to put my name on things that I'm not proud of, I've made and I continue to make a
                consistent effort to produce high-quality and often over-the-top work both as a student and as an
                employee.
            </p>
            <p>
                Attending remotely with a full-time job, I unfortunately did not participate in any research projects
                with faculty, nor in any CS-related campus clubs or activities, but I feel my lack of involvement in
                those areas has been counterbalanced by frequent eye-opening deep dives into unfamiliar CS topics like
                deep learning, formal verification with symbolic model checking, the design of metamodels with
                <a target="_blank" href="https://webgme.org">WebGME</a>
                to craft domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs), and much more. I've spent many a morning,
                afternoon, and night reading, writing, and coding as part of this program in pursuit of the idea
                conveyed by an admittedly overused Einstein quote:
                <strong>
                    <q>
                        If you can't explain it simply then you don't understand it well enough.
                    </q>
                </strong>
                This program has really pushed me to deconstruct things I do not understand into smaller and smaller
                components until I can explain the full idea, and thus has undoubtedly improved my ability to both speak
                and write simply about complex technical topics. Classes like Distributed Systems and Principles of
                Cloud Computing (both taught by

                    Dr. Aniruddha Gokhale</a>) posed challenges not only of
                <strong>designing and building</strong>

                    demonstrating</a> how those systems work. Just a few months ago, a topic like quantum computing
                seemed
                beyond cognitive reach and more like an abstract science fiction subject, but I have now written a full
                five-page paper analyzing a quantum-resistant, lattice-based digital signature scheme called
                <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/" target="_blank">
                    CRYSTALS-Dilithium
                </a>
                and have

                    implemented Shor's prime factorization algorithm

                    Qiskit-based quantum programming
                </a>
                as part of Dr. Easttom's Quantum Computing course. Similarly, prior to this program, I didn't have any
                experience with machine learning, and certainly could not have explained things like backpropagation,
                overfitting, or feature engineering, but as part of CS-5262, I have now worked hands-on with low-level
                training, validation and testing of machine learning models for things like employee churn prediction
                and image classification in
                <a href="https://colab.research.google.com" target="_blank">
                    Google Colab
                </a>
                and have also acquired a bigger-picture grasp on the machine learning workflow and the determination of
                a given model's business value (or lack thereof).

                Theoretical understanding is certainly critical to growth and success in the computer science domain,
                and theory has been a major part of this program's curriculum. On that same note, though, learning how
                to use new tools is also an important part of growth as a developer &mdash; one cannot keep up with a
                shifting landscape without a similarly shifting skillset. Each course that I have taken as a Vanderbilt
                student has not only introduced me to new tools but has required me to use them in solving equally new
                kinds of problems. With these applied introductions, I've gotten to work in a practical way with tools
                like

                As part of this program, I have also started writing and publishing computer science articles on
                platforms like
                <a href="https://dev.to/austinjhunt" target="_blank">DEV</a> and
                <a href="https://austinjhunt.medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a>; it has been my goal for a year or
                so to start actively engaging with and contributing to the developer community in this form to
                strengthen my public profile. Professor Hays's course on security in software engineering, with its
                plethora of open-ended homework questions on key cybersecurity topics, has given me the exact push I
                needed to establish a consistent technical blog, which now contains a series of articles under the

                                <em> <q>Because of some changes Google made to the pricing of their education offerings,
                                        we had to transition from having unlimited Google Drive storage to a fairly
                                        small,
                                        limited amount. I had a LOT of stuff in my Google Drive, both teaching and
                                        research
                                        related, and I tried a few different ways to move it over to OneDrive with very
                                        little success. After posting about my frustrations on Yammer, Austin jumped in
                                        and
                                        let me know he (possibly in conjunction with other colleagues?) had built a
                                        migration tool that we could use. He got me all set up, and of course my
                                        ridiculously large amount of data broke the tool multiple times, but he kept
                                        working
                                        at it until he was able to get everything migrated from Google Drive to
                                        OneDrive.
                                        I'm sure it was a huge pain on his end, but I really appreciated it!</q></em>
