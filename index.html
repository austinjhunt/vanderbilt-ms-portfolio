        <h4>Professional Goals</h4>
        <h4>Academic Achievements During M.S. Program</h4>
        <p>
          Since starting the M.S. program in the summer of 2021, I've taken less
          than a week off from my full-time development job and have maintained
          a 4.0 GPA while taking two classes each semester. I've included a
          screenshot below of my Academic Record as of today, which excludes the
          classes that I'm currently taking.
        </p>
        <div class="center mt-3 mb-3">
          <img
            src="img/gpa.png"
            style="width: 50%; border: 1px solid grey"
            alt="4.0 GPA maintained over the M.S. in C.S. program while taking two classes per semester and working a full time job"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          I did learn early as a high school student that the objective with
          school is <strong>to learn and explore</strong>, not to get good
          grades - good grades tend to be the natural byproduct of excitement
          and interest, sort of like how wave function collapse in quantum
          mechanics is the natural byproduct of environmental interaction (I
          just learned this in CS 8395: Quantum Computing). I say this to
          emphasize that my GPA has less to do with an obsession with my record
          than a real appetite for growing as a technical professional. With
          this appetite, and a supplemental unwillingness to put my name on
          things that I'm not proud of, I've made and I continue to make a
          consistent effort to produce high-quality and often over-the-top work.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a remote student with a full-time job, I unfortunately did not
          engage in any research projects with faculty, nor in any CS-related
          campus clubs or activities, but I feel my lack of engagement in those
          areas was counterbalanced by frequent eye-opening deep dives into
          unfamiliar CS topics like deep learning, formal verification with
          symbolic model checking, and the design of metamodels with
          <a target="_blank" href="https://webgme.org">WebGME</a> to craft
          domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs). I've spent many a morning,
          afternoon, and night reading, writing, and coding as part of this
          program under the close guidance from an admittedly overused Einstein
          quote:
          <strong
            ><q
              >If you can't explain it simply then you don't understand it well
              enough.</q
            ></strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, this program has undoubtedly helped me to become a stronger
          technical communicator - both as a speaker and a writer. Classes like
          CS6387 and CS6381 (both taught by
          <a

          >) posed challenges not only of
          <strong>designing and building</strong> things like complex

          >, but also of providing recorded and live demonstrations of those
          systems with explanations of how they functioned. through I've
          produced a number of YouTube videos and articles walking through
          things like email security, distributed systems management, and
          cloud-based data pipelines Tying academics to work. migration of data.
