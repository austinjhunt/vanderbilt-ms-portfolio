            <h3>Professional Goals &amp; Interests</h3>
            <p>
                While I struggle to set specific career goals in stone on a landscape
                as kaleidoscopic and shifting as computer science, I know
                independently of that shifting that I want to solve problems and help
                people &mdash; ideally in a creative and collaborative environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having spent a number of years working in network infrastructure with
                an encouraging team at
                <a href="https://cofc.edu" target="_blank">College of Charleston</a>
                that was always ready to explain and improve upon how things worked, I
                do have a special interest in computer networking &mdash; especially
                as it intersects with automation. I remember the thrill of getting to
                write my first script for automating firmware upgrades of
                <a href="https://www.tripplite.com/" target="_blank">Tripp Lite</a>
                UPSes, and then later the excitement of learning how to use
                <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank">Ansible</a>
                to manage bulk configuration changes across a network, and then later
                the hands-on fun of using that skill to configure a cluster of RHEL
                <a href="https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-2/latest/doc/01-about/" target="_blank">
                    Icinga 2
                </a>
                satellite servers for a new network monitoring and alerting system.
                Watching what amounts to a series of gears click into place and
                function together to serve a collective purpose is a beautiful thing.
                That's why I carry a steadfast interest in understanding, designing,
                and building systems of moving parts, as was probably evident to Dr.
                Gokhale in my work for his Distributed Systems course, or perhaps to
                my parents in my childhood obsession with setting up and subsequently
                toppling mile-long chains of Dominoes, or crafting weird Rube Goldberg
                machines. I aim to follow this interest in all of my professional
                pursuits moving forward, with the understanding that distributed
                systems can manifest in many forms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, anyone who has worked with me longer than a month knows I'm
                an automation fanatic, and that will certainly be a defining factor in
                my professional trajectory. This enthusiasm was kickstarted when I was
                an undergraduate at College of Charleston and
                <a href="https://bowringj.people.cofc.edu/" target="_blank">
                    Dr. Jim Bowring
                </a>
                tasked my classmates and I with building our own automated testing
                frameworks from scratch for existing open source software projects on
                GitHub. Over the course of this MS program, I got to dive into many
                automation-centric projects, some collaborative and some individual,
                that allowed me to really work on and improve my skills as an
                automator in the context of a deeper toolkit including tools like
                <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank">Ansible</a>,
                <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">
                    Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</a>,
                <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>,
                <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant by HashiCorp</a>,
                <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Kafka</a>,
                and distributed datastores like
                <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/" target="_blank">Couchbase</a>.
                Also, a significant part of my day job involves discussing and
                identifying opportunities for automation with my teammates and
                implementing solutions with scripting, API development, and other
                codeless tools like
                <a href="https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Power Automate</a>, e.g.,
                automating mass data synchronization from on-premise network
                shares to SharePoint Online site collections, integrating our ITSM
                software with Cascade CMS to automate provisioning of accounts for new
                web content managers, using
                <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank">
                    GitHub Actions
                </a>
                and
                <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a>
                to automate the testing and deployment of a series of in-house web
                applications, and more. I find this kind of work, and more generally
                the
                <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/" target="_blank">
                    DevOps
                </a>
                domain, highly satisfying, and I aim to continuously integrate it, if
                you will, into my career as a technical professional.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last but especially not least, my love for full-stack web development
                is a major gravitational force in my life (pulling me primarily toward
                port 8000 on localhost, as
                <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a>
                is my favorite framework); the origin of this force was a research
                project started with
                <a href="https://www.amhajja.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Ayman Hajja</a>
                at
                <a href="https://cofc.edu" target="_blank">College of Charleston</a>
                in the fall of 2017. Our project, which we titled PolyPy, was a
                pedagogical web application specifically focused on Python education;
                it allowed instructors to use a set of novel templating frameworks to
                generate many (<em>Poly</em>) quasi-random Python (<em>Py</em>) coding
                challenges, assign those challenges to their students, and view
                detailed reports to gain insight into both shared and individual
                strengths and weaknesses related to both reading and writing Python
                code. From this project (our work on which is published in the
                <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9028712" target="_blank">
                    2019 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference proceedings</a>), I learned that full-stack web
                development provided the perfect
                blend of art and problem solving; it was a colorful concoction of
                coding and creativity, and I was obsessed. The PolyPy project lasted
                only for two years but it ultimately ignited my interest in developing
                for the web &mdash; an interest which is still steadily aflame and
                which will certainly help to illuminate my future career path.
            </p>
            <p>
                The past year and a half of active engagement in Vanderbilt
                University's challenge-laden MS program, combined with my full-time,
                fused IT role spanning networking, DevOps, and full-stack web
                development, provides me with a unique perspective that I know I can
                wield confidently moving forward. While I cannot quite concretely
                picture myself in a specific position, company, or location five years
                from now, I am searching for opportunities to make positive,
                real-world impacts in collaborative and creative ways with a motivated
                team.
            </p>
            <h3>Academic Achievements During MS Program</h3>
            <p>
                Since starting the MS program in the summer of 2021, I have also held
                a full-time development job and have maintained a 4.0 GPA while taking
                two classes each semester. This isn't necessarily the most exciting or
                sparkling achievement, but nonetheless it is certainly a product of
                continuous hard work both academically and professionally. I learned
                early as a high school student that the objective with school is to
                learn and explore, not to get good grades &mdash; good grades tend to
                be the natural byproduct of excitement and interest, sort of like how
                wave function collapse in quantum mechanics is the natural byproduct
                of environmental interaction (I just learned this in
                <a href="http://www.chuckeasttom.com/" target="_blank">
                    Dr. Easttom's
                </a>
                Quantum Computing course). I say this to emphasize that my GPA has
                less to do with an obsession with my record than a real appetite for
                growing professionally. With this appetite &mdash; and a supplemental
                unwillingness to put my name on things that I'm not proud of &mdash; I've
                made and I continue to make a consistent effort to produce
                high-quality and often over-the-top work both as a student and as an
                employee.
            </p>
            <p>
                Attending remotely with a full-time job, I unfortunately did not
                participate in any research projects with faculty, nor in any
                CS-related campus clubs or activities, but I feel my lack of
                involvement in those areas has been counterbalanced by frequent
                eye-opening deep dives into unfamiliar CS topics like deep learning,
                formal verification with symbolic model checking, the design of
                metamodels with
                <a target="_blank" href="https://webgme.org">WebGME</a>
                to craft domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs), and much more.
                I've spent many a morning, afternoon, and night reading, writing, and
                coding as part of this program in pursuit of the idea conveyed by an
                admittedly overused Einstein quote:
                <strong><q>If you can't explain it simply then you don't understand it well
                        enough.</q></strong>
                This program has really pushed me to deconstruct things I do not
                understand into smaller and smaller components until I can explain the
                full idea, and thus has undoubtedly improved my ability to both speak
                and write simply about complex technical topics. Classes like
                Distributed Systems and Principles of Cloud Computing (both taught by
                <a target="_blank" href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/aniruddha-gokhale">
                    Dr. Aniruddha Gokhale</a>) posed challenges not only of
                <strong>designing and building</strong>
                things like
                <a href="https://github.com/austinjhunt/vanderbiltcs6381-assignment3-PUBSUBQoS" target="_blank">
                    distributed publish-subscribe systems

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7YAIlm2iYk" target="_blank">clearly demonstrating</a>
                how those systems work. Just a few months ago, a topic like quantum
                computing seemed beyond cognitive reach and more like an abstract
                science fiction subject, but I have now written a full five-page paper
                analyzing a quantum-resistant, lattice-based digital signature scheme
                called
                <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/" target="_blank">
                    CRYSTALS-Dilithium
                </a>
                and have
                <a href="https://github.com/austinjhunt/qiskit/tree/main/shors-algorithm" target="_blank">
                    implemented Shor's prime factorization algorithm

                with
                <a href="https://qiskit.org/" target="_blank">
                    Qiskit-based quantum programming
                </a>
                as part of Dr. Easttom's Quantum Computing course. Similarly, prior to
                this program, I didn't have any experience with machine learning, and
                certainly could not have explained things like backpropagation,
                overfitting, or feature engineering, but as part of CS-5262, I have
                now worked hands-on with low-level training, validation and testing of
                machine learning models for things like employee churn prediction and
                image classification in
                <a href="https://colab.research.google.com" target="_blank">
                    Google Colab
                </a>
                and have also acquired a bigger-picture grasp on the machine learning
                workflow and the determination of a given model's business value (or
                lack thereof).

                Theoretical understanding is certainly critical to growth and success
                in the computer science domain, and theory has been a major part of
                this program's curriculum. On that same note, though, learning how to
                use new tools is also an important part of growth as a developer
                &mdash; one cannot keep up with a shifting landscape without a
                similarly shifting skillset. Each course that I have taken as a
                Vanderbilt student has not only introduced me to new tools but has
                required me to use them in solving equally new kinds of problems. With
                these applied introductions, I've gotten to work in a practical way
                with tools like
                <a href="https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/" target="_blank">nuXmv</a>
                for symbolic model checking (which I leveraged for an

                environment), or the lightweight

                As part of this program, I have also started writing and publishing
                computer science articles on platforms like

                it has been my goal for a year or so to start actively engaging with
                and contributing to the developer community in this form to strengthen
                my public developer profile. Professor Hays's course on security in
                software engineering, with its plethora of open-ended homework
                questions on key cybersecurity topics, has given me the exact push I
                needed to establish a consistent technical blog, which now contains a
                series of articles under the umbrella of software and information
                security, such as

                                    <q>Because of some changes Google made to the pricing of
                                        their education offerings, we had to transition from
                                        having unlimited Google Drive storage to a fairly small,
                                        limited amount. I had a LOT of stuff in my Google Drive,
                                        both teaching and research related, and I tried a few
                                        different ways to move it over to OneDrive with very
                                        little success. After posting about my frustrations on
                                        Yammer, Austin jumped in and let me know he (possibly in
                                        conjunction with other colleagues?) had built a migration
                                        tool that we could use. He got me all set up, and of
                                        course my ridiculously large amount of data broke the tool
                                        multiple times, but he kept working at it until he was
                                        able to get everything migrated from Google Drive to
                                        OneDrive. I'm sure it was a huge pain on his end, but I
                                        really appreciated it!</q></em>

                                This is an application called Cyberbull
                                Investment Simulator that I built with the Spring Framework as a final project for
                                Vanderbilt University CS-5278 (Principles of Software
                                Engineering). The
                                <strong>open-ended problem statement</strong> was as follows:
                                develop a large-scale software project that solves a problem
                                in your life and leverage established software architecture
                                design patterns in its design.

                                This project is a reflection of my personal interest in the
                                stock market and is an exploration of many

                                in the context of stocks and brokerage account management. It
                                provides an environment for a user to look at stock market
                                data and act on that data in a simulated brokerage account
                                that's completely free of financial risk. The application
                                makes heavy use of
                                <strong>object-oriented</strong> programming techniques for
                                <strong>structure and organization</strong>, as well as

                                and the <strong>computation</strong>. It also largely depends
                                on the

                                    </h4>
                                    <p>
                                        One important thing to note is that while a bank account
                                        simply has a balance associated with it, a brokerage
                                        account has both a balance and a core position. A core
                                        position represents a balance of uninvested cash just
                                        sitting in the account waiting to be invested or
                                        transferred somewhere. The
                                        <em>balance</em> is the sum of the investment values in
                                        the account's portfolios and the core position. Now, for
                                        handling transfers, we are only interested in the
                                        transferable balance of an account, which for a brokerage
                                        account is just the core position. So, to find
                                        transferable balance of an account that could be one of
                                        two different types, Cyberbull uses the strategy pattern.
                                        The
                                        <a target="_blank"

                                        class serves as the context which takes in an account and
                                        routes the "get the transferable balance" logic to the
                                        appropriate strategy (there's a bank account balance
                                        finder strategy which just returns the balance if it's a
                                        bank account, and a brokerage account strategy which
                                        returns the core position if it's a brokerage account).
                                        This way, the client doesn't need to know what type an
                                        account is, or how to handle that type.

                                        With the factory method, you provide an interface for
                                        creating objects in a superclass, but you use subclasses
                                        to change the type of object that gets created.

                                        When managing a stock portfolio, you can open different
                                        types of positions depending basically on what you are
                                        hoping to profit off of. In a nutshell, if you want to
                                        profit off of a business losing money, you can open a
                                        short position, AKA you can "short" the company's stock.
                                        Alternatively, and most commonly, you may want to profit
                                        off of a company's growth buy buying shares and selling
                                        them at a later date at a higher price; this is called a
                                        "long" position. You can check out

                                        The factory pattern is also used to generate random
                                        phrases (for titles and descriptions) for the different
                                        account types. Since this is a simulator, it allows for
                                        you to randomly generate new accounts without having to
                                        manually enter account numbers, routing numbers, titles,

                                        The visitor pattern, as mentioned in the link above, "lets

                                        easily provide multiple methods of accessing price history
                                        of a stock. Specifically, the visitor (one of the concrete

                                        an interval determined by the type of visitor, e.g. daily,
                                        monthly, or weekly. That is, different types of visitors
                                        "visit" the historical data to generate a
                                        differently-intervaled lists of historical price points.

                                        As discussed in the link above, a proxy controls access to
                                        some original object, allowing you to perform something
                                        either before or after the request reaches that original
                                        object. In the context of this project, the proxy pattern
                                        comes to life with the

                                        class. This is because Cyberbull is largely dependent on
                                        YahooFinance. It pulls YahooFinance data at runtime specific to
                                        chosen stocks, e.g. opens, closes, volumes, general price
                                        information, etc. The proxy pattern is seen in how the

                                virtualized network with a tool like Mininet. It offers two main models of message
                                dissemination, namely <strong>centralized dissemination</strong> in which a message
                                broker forwards all messages from publisher to subscriber and decouples/anonymizes their
                                communication, and
                                <strong>decentralized dissemination</strong> in which a publisher and subscriber speak
                                directly with each other after a broker matches them with each other.

                                subscribers to write out latency data (between publishers and subscribers) to a provided
                                filename, which provide insight about how long it takes for messages with specific
                                topics from specific publishers to reach the subscriber (this is done by including the
                                publish time in the message that gets sent).

                            <p>The original problem statement merely required that we define the base logic for
                                creating publishers, subscribers, and brokers with some quality of service guarantees
                                using ZooKeeper.
                                However, as mentioned earlier in this portfolio, I love automating things, and building
                                a framework to dynamically spin up these entities in a parameterized way made the most
                                sense to me.

                                    <p>Once created, Subscriber 2 is randomly assigned to an existing zone. Zone 2 is
                                        the only zone currently. The subscriber registers with the primary broker for
                                        that zone (Broker 1). It sends a registration message identifying itself (its
                                        address, its id, the topics to which it subscribes, and its requested history

                                        znode with Subscriber 2's identifying info as a child of the shared state

                                    <p>The publisher gets randomly assigned to Zone 1 (of the two Zones), and thus

                                        registration. Broker 3 subscribes to Publisher 1 and updates the
                                        <code>/shared_state/publishers</code> znode with the information of this new
                                        publisher, and the other brokers (1 and 2) in the system (who are watching that
                                        znode) update their local information to include that publisher's information.
                                        The system load is now 1.5 (2 subs + 1 pub / 2 zones = 3 / 2 = 1.5).

                                    <p>The publisher begins publishing messages for topic A, but nothing else happens in
                                        the system. This is because the one subscriber to topic A in the system is
                                        requesting a history (sliding window size) of 3, but the publisher is only
                                        offering a size of 1 by default since no argument was passed for that setting.
                                        Thus, it cannot support the request of the topic A subscriber. In other words,
                                        this publisher's messages are currently not going any farther than Broker 3 in
                                        Zone 1 (they're being ignored). To address this, we can kill Publisher 1 with
                                        CTRL+C, and restart it with a history argument value of 5. When it's killed, it
                                        unregisters from the system and the shared state system load value drops back to

                                        size of 1 (default), and Broker 1 has "made their match" based on their topic

                                        another publisher already owns topic A (it's locked), and thus it does not

                                        information, and updates the shared system load state value to 2.5 (3 subs + 2
                                        pubs / 2 zones = 2.5). The BackupPool reads this change, compares it to the
                                        system load
                                        threshold (it's higher!), and then automatically provisions a new zone (Zone 3)
                                        with a new primary broker (Broker 4); this reduces the system load back down to

                                        <code>/shared_state/current_load</code>. The logs from the new broker are
                                        printed to standard output in the same window as the BackupPool since that is
                                        the process that spawned the new broker. Now, any new client (pub or sub) will
                                        have one additional possible zone to be randomly assigned to for broker
                                        communication (with options of zone 1, zone 2, and zone 3). Note that when this

                                        existing brokers' shared state, pulled in all of their collective matchmaking
                                        data, and handed it to the new broker to ensure it was synchronized as a new

                                to handle <strong>multi-broker</strong> pub/sub with <strong>warm passive</strong>
                                replication between brokers. The ZooKeeper usage was completely transparent, meaning if
                                you used one broker, the project
                                functions exactly the same as the first (which did not use ZooKeeper and was only
                                functional with one broker). If you use multiple brokers in iteration 2, and one broker
                                fails, ZooKeeper enables all publishers and subscribers to continue functioning as
                                though nothing happened by simply electing the next available broker as the leader.

                                    <p><strong>Load balancing</strong> in addition to fault tolerance. In the second
                                        iteration, we
                                        used ZooKeeper for
                                        fault tolerance using the primary-backup scheme without caring about the load on
                                        the
                                        primary broker. Now, we introduce load balancing such that there can be multiple
                                        primary
                                        broker replicas that each handle requests from clients (a client is a publisher
                                        or a
                                        subscriber). Each message broker that gets created gets assigned to a
                                        <strong>zone</strong>.
                                        The
                                        first broker assigned to a zone becomes its primary broker (or "leader"), then
                                        any
                                        additional brokers assigned to that zone become "contenders" for leadership in
                                        that
                                        zone, so each zone has one primary leader broker and a set of backup brokers
                                        that step
                                        in if the current primary fails (thus, each zone has its own <strong>fault
                                            tolerance</strong>). Load
                                        is balanced across zones by <strong>randomly</strong> assigning clients (pubs
                                        and subs) to
                                        one of
                                        the available zones at the time of creation. Ex: if there are 3 zones, each with
                                        a
                                        primary broker as its leader, and I create a publisher, that publisher gets
                                        randomly
                                        assigned to one of those 3 zones. A <strong>BackupPool</strong> process keeps
                                        track
                                        of the current
                                        system

                                        When the load
                                        exceeds
                                        the user-defined threshold, a new broker gets created and added to a brand new

                                        more distributed load balancing, and new clients include the new zone in the
                                        random zone

                                        than one publisher
                                        publishing the same topic T, then all the events from all of those publishers
                                        would get
                                        relayed to the subscribers subscribed to topic T. Now, we introduce a measure of
                                        topic
                                        ownership for publishers, so that only messages about topic T from the publisher
                                        with
                                        the highest ownership strength over that topic T are relayed to the interested
                                        subscribers. The first publisher to publish about a topic Becomes the owner for

                                        topic By acquiring an Apache ZooKeeper lock representing that topic. Any other

                                        that tries to publish about that topic will not be able to until that lock is

                                        which happens when the first publisher process ends, intentionally or not.</p>

                                    <p><strong>History.</strong> In the first iterations, when a publisher of topic T
                                        and a subscriber to topic T registered with a broker, that publisher and that
                                        subscriber were
                                        matched based on that topic T, and the subscriber would receive all messages
                                        about topic T, one at a time, as the publisher published those messages. Now, we
                                        introduce a new requirement
                                        that the last N messages published about a topic T be preserved in a sliding
                                        window
                                        fashion, and a subscriber to T can only receive messages from a publisher of T
                                        if
                                        the
                                        subscriber requests some number of messages less than or equal to the size of
                                        that
                                        sliding window offered by the publisher. In other words, the publisher's
                                        "offered"
                                        historical window of messages MUST be greater than or equal to the subscriber's
                                        "requested" number of historical messages. If a publisher maintains the last 10

                                        of topic T while a subscriber wants the last 20 samples of topic T, then this
                                        subscriber
                                        cannot get the data even though the topic of interest is common, because the

                                        requested" dominance relationship is not satisfied.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        In iteration 2, there was only a single ZooKeeper broker election observed by
                                        the brokers to achieve fault tolerance. This used an <code>/electionpath</code>
                                        znode
                                        with ZooKeeper. The first broker to get created won the election immediately and
                                        became the leader, and any subsequent brokers would become contenders for the
                                        leadership by entering the <code>/electionpath</code> election and waiting for
                                        the current leader to fail (those savages!). Now, with the load balancing model,
                                        we have multiple zones that <strong>each have their own broker
                                            elections</strong>. So instead of elections being managed with
                                        a single <code>/electionpath</code> znode, elections are now managed per-zone,
                                        with
                                        <code>/elections/zone_ZONENUMBER</code>. Within a
                                        given zone, the leader election happens
                                        the same way as before. When you create a broker, you assign it to a zone.
                                        If it's the first broker assigned to that zone, the zone-related znodes are
                                        initialized (including that election znode) and that broker becomes the
                                        zone's primary, or leader. If you assign a broker to a zone that already has
                                        a primary, it will enter the election for that zone and wait for the zone's
                                        primary to fail as a contender in the zone's leader election. The contenders are
                                        the backups, so this provides fault tolerance for each zone in the system, and
                                        thus for the system as a whole.

                                        We also now use ZooKeeper to maintain shared state across all of the brokers,
                                        particularly for the synchronization of matchmaking data. Why did we do this?
                                        Well, assume we hadn't. Now, imagine a publisher of topic A with an offered
                                        history of 5 gets created and is randomly assigned to zone 3, which means it
                                        registers with zone 3's primary broker. Then, a subscriber to topic A with a
                                        requested history of 2 gets created and is randomly assigned to zone 1.
                                        Regardless of centralized vs decentralized dissemination, without shared state
                                        across the brokers in the different zones, the subscriber would not know about
                                        the publisher even though it publishes its topic of interest and satisfies the
                                        offered vs requested dominance relationship. So, here's how the shared state
                                        works:

                                        ZooKeeper znode called <code>/shared_state/current_load</code>. Here's how it is
                                        used:</p>

                                            <p>We have a BackupPool process that watches this znode for data changes
                                                with @DataWatch. When it changes, if the value of the znode (the current
                                                system load) is greater than a user defined threshold passed to the the
                                                Backup Pool process, then provision, configure, and start a new broker

                                            <p>Whenever a new publisher or a subscriber registers OR disconnects with
                                                any
                                                broker in any zone, update <code>/shared_state/current_load</code> to

                                                (num_zones). Generally speaking, registration means load increase,
                                                disconnection means load decrease.</p>

                                    <h4>Watch Event</h4>
                                    <p>In iteration 2, each publisher and subscriber set a watch on the znode
                                        <code>/broker</code> which would store the information about the current leader,
                                        or primary,
                                        broker, which most recently won the <code>/electionpath</code> election. Now, as
                                        we have made
                                        the elections zone-specific with <code>/elections/zone_ZONENUMBER</code> znodes,
                                        we have also made
                                        this primary broker info storage zone specific, since each zone has its own
                                        primary, or leader. So instead of writing its information to /broker when a
                                        broker becomes a zone leader, it writes its information to
                                        <code>/primaries/zone_ZONENUMBER</code> when it becomes a zone leader. In
                                        return, the publishers and
                                        subscribers, after getting randomly assigned to a zone on creation,
                                        begin watching their respective <code>/primaries/zone_ZONENUMBER</code> to
                                        obtain the most
                                        updated information about their current broker leader. If it
                                        changes, that means the previous primary/leader broker has died or
                                        has been manually terminated and they register with the next broker
                                        contender who wins the zone's election.

                    <h3>Automation</h3>
                    <p>The framework is architected such that all it needs is an AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access
                        Key set as environment variables. It can be executed with Vagrant using the command
                        <code>vagrant up --provision</code>. The provisioner for the Vagrant box is an Ansible Playbook
                        that handles the automatic provisioning and configuration of a set of Ubuntu 20.04 AWS EC2
                        instances and then kicks off the test framework via a central, parameterized <a
                            href="https://github.com/austinjhunt/automated-couchbase-evaluation/blob/master/src/driver.py"
                            target="_blank">driver</a> file. The framework itself then uses the provisioned EC2
                        instances to automatically and iteratively create and tear down various Couchbase cluster
                        architectures via custom Python classes <a
                            href="https://github.com/austinjhunt/automated-couchbase-evaluation/blob/master/src/lib/DataManager.py"
                            target="_blank">DataManager</a> and <a
                            href="https://github.com/austinjhunt/automated-couchbase-evaluation/blob/master/src/lib/ClusterManager.py"
                            target="_blank">ClusterManager</a>. Python is used for not only the data management
                        (via DataManager) via the provided Python 3 SDK, but also the management of the cluster
                        architecture (via ClusterManager) in order to eliminate the need for interacting manually with
                        the Couchbase Web GUI. Note: since much of the cluster architecture management could not be done
                        using the default Python 3 SDK, we created methods that "wrapped" the Couchbase CLI (which could
                        manage cluster architecture) to make this a <strong>fully Pythonic project.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>The framework writes out latency data during test execution, which is used afterward to generate
                        various plots that reveal relationships between the various variables we tune (e.g. cluster size
                        vs. operation latency and bucket size vs. operation latency). If you want plots when the
                        framework is done running tests, just pass -plt to the driver.</p>

                    <p>Guoliang and I divided the work for the paper up such that he covered the analysis of Couchbase's
                        architecture, and I covered the analysis of the automation framework, including the results from
                        its execution. On the software side, I worked on building the Python automation framework and
                        setting it up to link with Ansible, Vagrant, and AWS EC2, and Guoliang worked with the
                        integration of the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark data workloads into that framework.

                    <p>I wrote the following paper for the CS-8395 Special Topics: Quantum Computing course taught by
                        Dr.
                        Easttom. The challenge was provide an analysis of a chosen quantum-resistant cryptographic
                        algorithm, and while doing some initial investigation I came across a <a
                            href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms"
                            target="_blank">July 2022 announcement</a> from the
                        National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) about the first group of winning
                        quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms from its six-year competition; <a
                            href="https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/" target="_blank">CRYSTALS-Dilithium</a> was
                        one of those. Before writing, I knew nothing about quantum-resistant cryptography or the role of
                        lattice-based mathematics in that domain. However, I had recently written an <a
                            href="https://austinjhunt.medium.com/breaking-down-modern-trust-digital-signatures-and-their-impact-on-business-2dfbd4120dae"
                            target="_blank">article</a> about digital signatures and their impact on modern business
                        security, so CRYSTALS-Dilithium &mdash; a digital signature scheme &mdash; struck me
                        as a worthwhile investigation. <strong>It's easier to learn about new things if you can connect
                            them to
                            things you've already learned about.</strong> With that, I should note that when writing
                        this paper, I made a concerted effort to provide as much background and context around new
                        topics before referencing or introducing them. For example, before diving too deeply into a
                        discussion of lattice-based cryptography and its value in quantum resistance, I first provide an
                        explanation of lattices in relation to vector spaces. Also, before discussing the Closest Vector
                        Problem (CVP), I make an effort to explain the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), which is
                        generalized by CVP. There are other instances of this deconstruction and contextualization in
                        the paper. I mentioned
                        earlier in this portfolio that I have made a habit of deconstructing things I don't understand
                        until I can meaningfully reassemble the parts I do understand. I took that approach with this
                        paper, which entailed a significant amount of research on my part in the forms of reading other
                        papers and
                        articles and watching quite a few YouTube videos, including this <a
