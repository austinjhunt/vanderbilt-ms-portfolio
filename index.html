        <h3>Professional Goals &amp; Interests</h3>
        <p>
          While I struggle to set specific career goals in stone on a landscape
          as kaleidoscopic and shifting as computer science, I know
          independently of that shifting that I want to solve problems and help
          people &mdash; ideally in a creative and collaborative environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having spent a number of years working in network infrastructure with
          an encouraging team at
          <a href="https://cofc.edu" target="_blank">College of Charleston</a>
          that was always ready to explain and improve upon how things worked, I
          do have a special interest in computer networking &mdash; especially
          as it intersects with automation. I remember the thrill of getting to
          write my first script for automating firmware upgrades of
          <a href="https://www.tripplite.com/" target="_blank">Tripp Lite</a>
          UPSes, and then later the excitement of learning how to use
          <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank">Ansible</a>
          to manage bulk configuration changes across a network, and then later
          the hands-on fun of using that skill to configure a cluster of RHEL
          <a
            href="https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-2/latest/doc/01-about/"
            target="_blank"
          >
            Icinga 2
          </a>
          satellite servers for a new network monitoring and alerting system.
          Watching what amounts to a series of gears click into place and
          function together to serve a collective purpose is a beautiful thing.
          That's why I carry a steadfast interest in understanding, designing,
          and building systems of moving parts, as was probably evident to Dr.
          Gokhale in my work for his Distributed Systems course, or perhaps to
          my parents in my childhood obsession with setting up and subsequently
          toppling mile-long chains of Dominoes, or crafting weird Rube Goldberg
          machines. I aim to follow this interest in all of my professional
          pursuits moving forward, with the understanding that distributed
          systems can manifest in many forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, anyone who has worked with me longer than a month knows I'm
          an automation fanatic, and that will certainly be a defining factor in
          my professional trajectory. This enthusiasm was kickstarted when I was
          an undergraduate at College of Charleston and
          <a href="https://bowringj.people.cofc.edu/" target="_blank">
            Dr. Jim Bowring
          </a>
          tasked my classmates and I with building our own automated testing
          frameworks from scratch for existing open source software projects on
          GitHub. Over the course of this MS program, I got to dive into many
          automation-centric projects, some collaborative and some individual,
          that allowed me to really work on and improve my skills as an
          automator in the context of a deeper toolkit including tools like
          <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank">Ansible</a>,
          <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">
            Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</a
          >,
          <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank"
            >Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a
          >,
          <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank"
            >Vagrant by HashiCorp</a
          >,
          <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Kafka</a>,
          and distributed datastores like
          <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/" target="_blank">Couchbase</a>.
          Also, a significant part of my day job involves discussing and
          identifying opportunities for automation with my teammates and
          implementing solutions with scripting, API development, and other
          codeless tools like
          <a href="https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank"
            >Power Automate</a
          >, e.g., automating mass data synchronization from on-premise network
          shares to SharePoint Online site collections, integrating our ITSM
          software with Cascade CMS to automate provisioning of accounts for new
          web content managers, using
          <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank">
            GitHub Actions
          </a>
          and
          <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a>
          to automate the testing and deployment of a series of in-house web
          applications, and more. I find this kind of work, and more generally
          the
          <a
            href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/"
            target="_blank"
          >
            DevOps
          </a>
          domain, highly satisfying, and I aim to continuously integrate it, if
          you will, into my career as a technical professional.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but especially not least, my love for full-stack web development
          is a major gravitational force in my life (pulling me primarily toward
          port 8000 on localhost, as
          <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a>
          is my favorite framework); the origin of this force was a research
          project started with
          <a href="https://www.amhajja.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Ayman Hajja</a>
          at
          <a href="https://cofc.edu" target="_blank">College of Charleston</a>
          in the fall of 2017. Our project, which we titled PolyPy, was a
          pedagogical web application specifically focused on Python education;
          it allowed instructors to use a set of novel templating frameworks to
          generate many (<em>Poly</em>) quasi-random Python (<em>Py</em>) coding
          challenges, assign those challenges to their students, and view
          detailed reports to gain insight into both shared and individual
          strengths and weaknesses related to both reading and writing Python
          code. From this project (our work on which is published in the
          <a
            href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9028712"
            target="_blank"
          >
            2019 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference proceedings</a
          >), I learned that full-stack web development provided the perfect
          blend of art and problem solving; it was a colorful concoction of
          coding and creativity, and I was obsessed. The PolyPy project lasted
          only for two years but it ultimately ignited my interest in developing
          for the web &mdash; an interest which is still steadily aflame and
          which will certainly help to illuminate my future career path.
        </p>
        <p>
          The past year and a half of active engagement in Vanderbilt
          University's challenge-laden MS program, combined with my full-time,
          fused IT role spanning networking, DevOps, and full-stack web
          development, provides me with a unique perspective that I know I can
          wield confidently moving forward. While I cannot quite concretely
          picture myself in a specific position, company, or location five years
          from now, I am searching for opportunities to make positive,
          real-world impacts in collaborative and creative ways with a motivated
          team.
        </p>
        <h3>Academic Achievements During MS Program</h3>
        <p>
          Since starting the MS program in the summer of 2021, I have also held
          a full-time development job and have maintained a 4.0 GPA while taking
          two classes each semester. This isn't necessarily the most exciting or
          sparkling achievement, but nonetheless it is certainly a product of
          continuous hard work both academically and professionally. I learned
          early as a high school student that the objective with school is to
          learn and explore, not to get good grades &mdash; good grades tend to
          be the natural byproduct of excitement and interest, sort of like how
          wave function collapse in quantum mechanics is the natural byproduct
          of environmental interaction (I just learned this in
          <a href="http://www.chuckeasttom.com/" target="_blank">
            Dr. Easttom's
          </a>
          Quantum Computing course). I say this to emphasize that my GPA has
          less to do with an obsession with my record than a real appetite for
          growing professionally. With this appetite &mdash; and a supplemental
          unwillingness to put my name on things that I'm not proud of, I've
          made and I continue to make a consistent effort to produce
          high-quality and often over-the-top work both as a student and as an
          employee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attending remotely with a full-time job, I unfortunately did not
          participate in any research projects with faculty, nor in any
          CS-related campus clubs or activities, but I feel my lack of
          involvement in those areas has been counterbalanced by frequent
          eye-opening deep dives into unfamiliar CS topics like deep learning,
          formal verification with symbolic model checking, the design of
          metamodels with
          <a target="_blank" href="https://webgme.org">WebGME</a>
          to craft domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs), and much more.
          I've spent many a morning, afternoon, and night reading, writing, and
          coding as part of this program in pursuit of the idea conveyed by an
          admittedly overused Einstein quote:
          <strong
            ><q
              >If you can't explain it simply then you don't understand it well
              enough.</q
            ></strong
          >
          This program has really pushed me to deconstruct things I do not
          understand into smaller and smaller components until I can explain the
          full idea, and thus has undoubtedly improved my ability to both speak
          and write simply about complex technical topics. Classes like
          Distributed Systems and Principles of Cloud Computing (both taught by
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/aniruddha-gokhale"
          >
            Dr. Aniruddha Gokhale</a
          >) posed challenges not only of
          <strong>designing and building</strong>
          things like
          <a
            href="https://github.com/austinjhunt/vanderbiltcs6381-assignment3-PUBSUBQoS"
            target="_blank"

            distributed publish-subscribe systems
          </a>
          and
          <a

            target="_blank"
            >cloud-based data processing pipelines</a
          >, but also of

            >clearly demonstrating</a
          >
          how those systems work. Just a few months ago, a topic like quantum
          computing seemed beyond cognitive reach and more like an abstract
          science fiction subject, but I have now written a full five-page paper
          analyzing a quantum-resistant, lattice-based digital signature scheme
          called
          <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/" target="_blank">
            CRYSTALS-Dilithium
          </a>
          and have
          <a
            href="https://github.com/austinjhunt/qiskit/tree/main/shors-algorithm"
            target="_blank"
          >
            implemented Shor's prime factorization algorithm
          </a>
          with
          <a href="https://qiskit.org/" target="_blank">
            Qiskit-based quantum programming
          </a>
          as part of Dr. Easttom's Quantum Computing course. Similarly, prior to
          this program, I didn't have any experience with machine learning, and
          certainly could not have explained things like backpropagation,
          overfitting, or feature engineering, but as part of CS-5262, I have
          now worked hands-on with low-level training, validation and testing of
          machine learning models for things like employee churn prediction and
          image classification in
          <a href="https://colab.research.google.com" target="_blank">

          Theoretical understanding is certainly critical to growth and success
          in the computer science domain, and theory has been a major part of
          this program's curriculum. On that same note, though, learning how to
          use new tools is also an important part of growth as a developer
          &mdash; one cannot keep up with a shifting landscape without a
          similarly shifting skillset. Each course that I have taken as a
          Vanderbilt student has not only introduced me to new tools but has
          required me to use them in solving equally new kinds of problems. With
          these applied introductions, I've gotten to work in a practical way
          with tools like
          <a href="https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/" target="_blank">nuXmv</a>

                  of 2022, I worked with our Human Resources department to
                  gather requirements for and set up on their behalf an
                  automated flow (with Power Automate) that would allow College
                  employees to recognize other employees for exhibiting one or

                      their education offerings, we had to transition from
                      having unlimited Google Drive storage to a fairly small,
                      limited amount. I had a LOT of stuff in my Google Drive,
                      both teaching and research related, and I tried a few
                      different ways to move it over to OneDrive with very
                      little success. After posting about my frustrations on
                      Yammer, Austin jumped in and let me know he (possibly in
                      conjunction with other colleagues?) had built a migration
                      tool that we could use. He got me all set up, and of
                      course my ridiculously large amount of data broke the tool
                      multiple times, but he kept working at it until he was
                      able to get everything migrated from Google Drive to
                      OneDrive. I'm sure it was a huge pain on his end, but I
                      really appreciated it!</q

                  This is an Spring Framework application called Cyberbull
                  Investment Simulator that I built as a final project for a
                  Vanderbilt University CS 5278 (Principles of Software
                  Engineering). The
                  <strong>open-ended problem statement</strong> was as follows:
                  develop a large-scale software project that solves a problem
                  in your life and leverage established software architecture
                  design patterns in its design.

                  This project is a reflection of my personal interest in the
                  stock market and is an exploration of many

                  in the context of stocks and brokerage account management. It
                  provides an environment for a user to look at stock market
                  data and act on that data in a simulated brokerage account
                  that's completely free of financial risk. The application
                  makes heavy use of
                  <strong>object-oriented</strong> programming techniques for
                  <strong>structure and organization</strong>, as well as
                  <strong>functional</strong> programming techniques to draw
                  <strong>clear connections</strong> between the
                  <strong>domain intent</strong> (brokerage account management)
                  and the <strong>computation</strong>. It also largely depends

                      position just represents some investment in some number of
                      shares of a stock), and a position can be updated over
                      time by buying or selling more of that position's stock,
                      Cyberbull also stores the operations affecting a given
                      position in an operation list for that position. This
                      means we can view a history of orders at the portfolio
                      level and at the position level (within that portfolio) on
                      an account dashboard.

                    <p>
                      One important thing to note is that while a bank account
                      simply has a balance associated with it, a brokerage
                      account has both a balance and a core position. A core
                      position represents a balance of uninvested cash just
                      sitting in the account waiting to be invested or
                      transferred somewhere. The
                      <em>balance</em> is the sum of the investment values in
                      the account's portfolios and the core position. Now, for
                      handling transfers, we are only interested in the
                      transferable balance of an account, which for a brokerage
                      account is just the core position. So, to find
                      transferable balance of an account that could be one of
                      two different types, Cyberbull uses the strategy pattern.

                      class serves as the context which takes in an account and
                      routes the "get the transferable balance" logic to the
                      appropriate strategy (there's a bank account balance
                      finder strategy which just returns the balance if it's a
                      bank account, and a brokerage account strategy which
                      returns the core position if it's a brokerage account).
                      This way, the client doesn't need to know what type an
                      account is, or how to handle that type.

                      With the factory method, you provide an interface for
                      creating objects in a superclass, but you use subclasses
                      to change the type of object that gets created.

                      When managing a stock portfolio, you can open different
                      types of positions depending basically on what you are
                      hoping to profit off of. In a nutshell, if you want to
                      profit off of a business losing money, you can open a
                      short position, AKA you can "short" the company's stock.
                      Alternatively, and most commonly, you may want to profit
                      off of a company's growth buy buying shares and selling
                      them at a later date at a higher price; this is called a
                      "long" position. You can check out

                      Now, for creating positions within the app, there is a
                      PositionFactory interface with a createPosition() method,
                      and an IPositionFactory superclass that implements that
                      interface to create a Position superclass. Below that,
                      there is a ShortPosition class and a LongPosition class,
                      representing the different subclasses, or types, of market
                      positions. Running parallel, there is a
                      ShortPositionFactory and a LongPositionFactory responsible
                      for creating those respective types of Position objects.
                      Below are code snippets for the LongPositionFactory and
                      LongPosition classes.

                      The factory pattern is also used to generate random
                      phrases (for titles and descriptions) for the different
                      account types. Since this is a simulator, it allows for
                      you to randomly generate new accounts without having to
                      manually enter account numbers, routing numbers, titles,
                      and descriptions. Currently, there is a

                      appropriate to their respective account types. For
                      example, a brokerage account title may be something like
                      "investments for retirement" but that same random choice
                      would not make sense for a bank account, which may be
                      titled something like "joint savings account" or "credit

                      an interval determined by the type of visitor, e.g. daily,
                      monthly, or weekly. That is, different types of visitors
                      "visit" the historical data to generate a

                      As discussed in the link above, a proxy controls access to
                      some original object, allowing you to perform something
                      either before or after the request reaches that original
                      object. In the context of this project, the proxy pattern
                      comes to life with the
