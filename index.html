        <p>
          While I struggle to set specific career goals in stone on a landscape
          as kaleidoscopic and shifting as computer science, I know
          independently of that shifting that I want to solve problems and help
          people, and I want to do that in a collaborative environment that
          promotes creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having spent a number of years working in network infrastructure with
          an encouraging team at
          <a href="https://cofc.edu" target="_blank">College of Charleston</a>
          that was always ready to explain and improve upon how things worked, I
          do have a special interest in computer networking - especially as it
          intersects with automation. I remember the thrill of getting to write
          my first script for automating firmware upgrades of
          <a href="https://www.tripplite.com/" target="_blank">Tripp Lite</a>
          UPSes, and then later the excitement of learning how to use
          <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank">Ansible</a>
          to manage bulk configuration changes across a network, and then later
          the hands-on fun of using that skill to configure a cluster of RHEL
          <a
            href="https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-2/latest/doc/01-about/"
            target="_blank"
          >
            Icinga 2
          </a>
          satellite servers for a new network monitoring and alerting system.
          Watching what amounts to a series of gears click into place and
          function together to serve a collective purpose is a beautiful thing.
          That's why I carry a steadfast interest in understanding, designing,
          and building systems of moving parts, as was probably evident to Dr.
          Gokhale in my work for his Distributed Systems course, or perhaps to
          my parents in my childhood obsession with setting up and subsequently
          toppling mile-long chains of Dominoes, or crafting weird Rube Goldberg
          machines. I aim to follow this interest in all of my professional
          pursuits moving forward, with the understanding that distributed
          systems can manifest in many forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, anyone who has worked with me longer than a month knows I'm
          an automation fanatic, and that will certainly be a defining factor in
          my professional trajectory. This enthusiasm was kickstarted when I was
          an undergraduate at College of Charleston and
          <a href="https://bowringj.people.cofc.edu/" target="_blank">
            Dr. Jim Bowring
          </a>
          tasked my classmates and I with building our own automated testing
          frameworks from scratch for existing open source software projects on
          GitHub. Over the course of this M.S. program, I got to dive into many
          automation-centric projects, some collaborative and some individual,
          that allowed me to really work on and improve my skills as an
          automator in the context of a deeper toolkit including tools like
          <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank">Ansible</a>
          ,
          <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">
            Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
          </a>
          ,
          <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">
            Amazon Web Services (AWS)
          </a>
          ,
          <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">
            Vagrant by HashiCorp
          </a>
          ,
          <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Kafka</a>
          , and distributed datastores like
          <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/" target="_blank">Couchbase</a>
          . Also, a significant part of my day job involves discussing and
          identifying opportunities for automation with my teammates and
          implementing solutions with scripting, API development, and other
          codeless tools like
          <a href="https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">
            Power Automate
          </a>
          , e.g., automating mass data synchronization from on-premise network
          shares to SharePoint online site collections, integrating our ITSM
          software with Cascade CMS to automate provisioning of accounts for new
          web content managers, using
          <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank">
            GitHub Actions
          </a>
          and
          <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a>
          to automate the testing and deployment of a series of in-house web
          applications, and more. I find this kind of work, and more generally
          the
          <a
            href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/"

          >
            DevOps
          </a>
          domain, highly satisfying, and I aim to continuously integrate it, if
          you will, into my career as a technical professional.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but especially not least, my love for full-stack web development
          has been a major gravitational force in my life (pulling me primarily
          toward port 8000 on localhost, as
          <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a>
          is my favorite framework) since starting a research project with
          <a href="https://www.amhajja.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Ayman Hajja</a>
          at
          <a href="https://cofc.edu" target="_blank">College of Charleston</a>
          in the fall of 2017. Our project, which we titled PolyPy, was a
          pedagogical web application specifically focused on Python education;
          it did this by allowing instructors to use a set of novel templating
          frameworks to generate many (<em>Poly</em>) quasi-random Python
          (<em>Py</em>) coding challenges, assigning those challenges to their
          students, and viewing reports of their answers to gain insight into
          both shared and individual strengths and weaknesses related to both
          reading and writing Python code. From this project (our work on which
          is published in the
          <a
            href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9028712"
            target="_blank"
          >
            2019 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference proceedings</a
          >), I learned that full-stack web development provided the perfect
          blend of art and problem solving; it was a colorful concoction of
          coding and creativity, and I was obsessed. The PolyPy project lasted
          only for two years but it ultimately ignited an interest in developing
          for the web which is still steadily aflame and which will certainly
          help to illuminate my future career path.
        </p>
        <p>
          The past year and a half of active engagement in Vanderbilt
          University's challenge-laden M.S. program, combined with my full-time,
          fused IT role spanning networking, DevOps, and full-stack web
          development, provides me with a unique perspective that I can wield
          confidently moving forward. While I cannot quite concretely picture
          myself in a specific position, company, or location five years from
          now, I am searching for opportunities to make positive, real-world
          impacts in collaborative and creative ways with a motivated team.
        </p>
        <h3>Academic Achievements During M.S. Program</h3>
        <p>
          Since starting the M.S. program in the summer of 2021, I have also
          held a full-time development job and have maintained a 4.0 GPA while
          taking two classes each semester. I've included a screenshot below of
          my Academic Record as of today, which excludes the classes that I'm
          currently taking (CS-6387 Topics in SWE: Security and CS-8395 Special
          Topics: Quantum Computing). This isn't necessarily the most exciting
          or sparkling achievement, but nonetheless it is certainly a product of
          continuous hard work both academically and professionally.

        </div>
        <p>
          I learned early as a high school student that the objective with
          school is
          <strong>to learn and explore</strong>
          , not to get good grades - good grades tend to be the natural
          byproduct of excitement and interest, sort of like how wave function
          collapse in quantum mechanics is the natural byproduct of
          environmental interaction (I just learned this in
          <a href="http://www.chuckeasttom.com/" target="_blank">
            Dr. Easttom's
          </a>
          Quantum Computing course). I say this to emphasize that my GPA has
          less to do with an obsession with my record than a real appetite for
          growing professionally. With this appetite, and a supplemental
          unwillingness to put my name on things that I'm not proud of, I've
          made and I continue to make a consistent effort to produce
          high-quality and often over-the-top work both as a student and as an
          employee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attending remotely with a full-time job, I unfortunately did not
          participate in any research projects with faculty, nor in any
          CS-related campus clubs or activities, but I feel my lack of
          involvement in those areas has been counterbalanced by frequent
          eye-opening deep dives into unfamiliar CS topics like deep learning,
          formal verification with symbolic model checking, the design of
          metamodels with
          <a target="_blank" href="https://webgme.org">WebGME</a>
          to craft domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs), and much more.
          I've spent many a morning, afternoon, and night reading, writing, and
          coding as part of this program in pursuit of the idea conveyed by an
          admittedly overused Einstein quote:
          <strong>
            <q>
              If you can't explain it simply then you don't understand it well
              enough.
            </q>
          </strong>
          This program has really pushed me to deconstruct things I do not
          understand into smaller and smaller components until I can explain the
          full idea, and thus has undoubtedly improved my ability to both speak
          and write simply about complex technical topics. Classes like
          Distributed Systems and Principles of Cloud Computing (both taught by
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/aniruddha-gokhale"
          >
            Dr. Aniruddha Gokhale
          </a>
          ) posed challenges not only of
          <strong>designing and building</strong>
          things like

            clearly demonstrating
          </a>
          how those systems work. Just a few months ago, a topic like quantum
          computing seemed beyond cognitive reach and more like an abstract
          science fiction subject, but I have now written a full five-page paper
          analyzing a quantum-resistant, lattice-based digital signature scheme
          called
          <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/" target="_blank">

            Qiskit-based quantum programming
          </a>
          as part of Dr. Easttom's Quantum Computing course. Similarly, prior to
          this program, I didn't have any experience with machine learning, and
          certainly could not have explained things like backpropagation,
          overfitting, or feature engineering, but as part of CS-5262, I have
          now worked hands-on with low-level training, validation and testing of
          machine learning models for things like employee churn prediction and
          image classification in
          <a href="https://colab.research.google.com" target="_blank">
            Google Colab
          </a>
          and have also acquired a bigger-picture grasp on the ML workflow and
          the determination of a given model's business value - or lack thereof.

          Theoretical understanding is certainly critical to growth and success
          in the computer science domain, and theory has been a major part of
          this program's curriculum. On that same note, though, learning how to
          use new tools is also an important part of growth as a developer - one
          cannot keep up with a shifting landscape without a similarly shifting
          skillset. Each course that I have taken as a Vanderbilt student has
          not only introduced me to new tools but has required me to use them in
          solving equally new kinds of problems. With these applied
          introductions, I've gotten to work in a practical way with tools like
          <a href="https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/" target="_blank">nuXmv</a>
          for symbolic model checking (which I leveraged for an

          As part of this program, I have also started writing and publishing
          computer science articles on platforms like

          and contributing to the developer community in this form to strengthen
          my public profile; Professor Hays's course on security in software
          engineering, with its plethora of open-ended homework questions on key
          cybersecurity topics, has given me the exact push I needed to
          establish a consistent technical blog, which now contains a series of
          articles under the umbrella of software and information security, such
          as
